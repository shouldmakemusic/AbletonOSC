RemixNet Module

This module contains four classes that have been assembled to facilitate
remote control of Ableton Live. It's been an interesting experience learning
Python and has given me a lot of time to think about music and networking
protocols. I used OSC as it's somewhat of an accepted protocol and at least
more flexible than MIDI. It's not the quickest protocol in terms of
pure ops, but it gets the job done. 

For most uses all you'll need to do is create an OSCServer object, it
in turn creates an OSCClient and registers a couple default callbacks
for you to test with. Both OSCClient and OSCServer create their own UDP
sockets this is settable on initialization and during runtime if you wish
to change them.

Any input or feedback on this code will always be appreciated and I look 
forward to seeing what will come next.

    Works on Mac OSX with Live7/8
    
    The socket module is missing on osx and including it from the default python install doesnt work.
    Turns out its the os module that causes all the problems, removing dependance on this module and 
    packaging the script with a modified version of the socket module allows it to run on osx.
