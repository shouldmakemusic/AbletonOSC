RemixNet Module

This module contains four classes that have been assembled to facilitate
remote control of Ableton Live. It's been an interesting experience learning
Python and has given me a lot of time to think about music and networking
protocols. I used OSC as it's somewhat of an accepted protocol and at least
more flexible than MIDI. It's not the quickest protocol in terms of
pure ops, but it gets the job done. 

For most uses all you'll need to do is create an OSCServer object, it
in turn creates an OSCClient and registers a couple default callbacks
for you to test with. Both OSCClient and OSCServer create their own UDP
sockets this is settable on initialization and during runtime if you wish
to change them.

Any input or feedback on this code will always be appreciated and I look 
forward to seeing what will come next.

    Works on Mac OSX with Live7/8
    
    The socket module is missing on osx and including it from the default python install doesnt work.
    Turns out its the os module that causes all the problems, removing dependance on this module and 
    packaging the script with a modified version of the socket module allows it to run on osx.

        This is the main class we the use as a nexus point in this module.
        
        - dst: destination/target host for OSC responses. If None will default to local network broadcast only.
        - src: Which local interface / ip to bind to, if unset defaults to all
        - srcPort: Source port to bind the server to for incoming OSC queries. Defaults to 9000
        - dstPort: Destination port for OSC responses sent by callbacks. Defaults to 9001       
        
        By default we define and set callbacks for two utility functions that may
        be useful in testing.
        
        /remix/echo -> OSCServer.callbackEcho() - For responding to /remix/echo queries.
        /remix/time -> OSCServer.callbackTime() - Returns time.time() (time in float seconds)
        
        I chose OSC to deliver messages out of necessity, my opinion of OSC at this
        point is that its addressing system is heavyweight although the idea is 
        a reasonable one. But taking into consideration the ratio of address:data
        it becomes somewhat unreasonable unless you take the route of making unreadable
        addresses. As an example I offer the following address,

        /ableton/track/1/volume/set float(0.98)

        To set a single 4 byte float value, we need to use a 27 byte string to get
        it routed to the correct area, and even then we need to make an O(N) comparison
        on the address since we don't have the luxury of a switch statement in Python.
        
        If you're trying to interact with devices in near-realtime the number of ops
        wasted on just getting things to the right place can take the wind out of
        your sails.
        
        But basically for this project to be accepted or useful to anyone it was 
        important to me that we provide a method of accessing that other tools
        could use without having to introduce a new linewire protocol.
        
        It should be noted that performance even with the added ops isn't that bad.
        On my dualcore system I was able to process about 1380 OSC callbacks per
        second. Or, ~86 callbacks per 60ms tick.

        This is the juice of our tool. While UDP is billed as an unreliable
        protocol, as it turns out it's not that bad. In fact, it can be pretty 
        good.
        
        There are several limitations to the Ableton Live Python environment. 
        
        * The Ableton Live Python environment is minimal. The included module
          list is very short. For instance, we don't have 'select()'.
          
        * The Ableton Live Python version is a bit older than what most Python
          programmers are used to. Its version string says 2.2.1, and the Python
          webpage shows that the offical 2.2.3 came out May 30, 2003. So we've
          got 4 years between us and it. Fortunately since I didn't know any Python
          when I got started on this project the version differences didn't bother 
          me. But I know the lack of modern features has been a pain for a few
          of our developers.
          
        * The Ableton Live Python environment, although it includes the thread
          module, doesn't function how you'd expect it to. The threads appear to
          be on a 100ms timer that cannot be altered consistently through Python.
          
          I did find an interesting behavior in that when you modify the
          sys.setcheckinterval value to very large numbers for about 1-5/100ths of
          a second thread focus goes away entirely and if your running thread is
          a 'while 1:' loop with no sleep, it gets 4-5 iterations in before 
          the thread management stuff kicks in and puts you down back to 100ms 
          loop.
          
          As a goof I tried making a thread that was a 'while 1:' loop with a
          sys.setcheckinterval(50000) inside it -- first iteration it triggered
          the behavior, then it stopped.
          
          It should also be noted that you can make a blocking TCP socket using
          the threads interface. But your refresh is going to be about 40ms slower
          than using a non-blocking UDP socket reader. But hey, you're the boss!
          
          So far the best performance for processing incoming packets can be found
          by attaching a method as a listener to the Song.current_song_time 
          attribute. This attribute updates every 60ms on the dot allowing for 
          16 passes on the incoming UDP traffic every second.
          
          My machine is pretty beefy but I was able to sustain an average of
          over 1300 /remix/echo callback hits a second and only lost .006% 
          of my UDP traffic over 10 million packets on a machine running Live.
          
          One final note -- I make no promises as to the latency of triggers recieved.
          I haven't tested that at all yet. Since the window is 60ms, don't get 
          your hopes up about MIDI over OSC.
